# The ReLDI web services library

This repository contains the documentation and some handy scripts for using the ReLDI web services library.

[ReLDI](https://reldi.spur.uzh.ch) is a SNSF-funded SCOPES project under which a series of resources and tools for processing South-Slavic languages were developed.

Some of the tools available through the library / web services were developed inside the [JANES](http://nl.ijs.si/janes/) and [CLARIN.SI](https://www.clarin.si) projects.

## Installing the library

The easiest way to install the ReLDI library is through [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi):

```
$ sudo pip install reldi
```
